## Instructor

 - Ross Barnowski (rossbar@berkeley.edu)
    - Office hours: TBD

## Assistants and Resources

 - Joseph Curtis (jccurtis@lbl.gov)  

## Session Dates
 - Lecture: Tu & Th 2-3 PM | 54 Barrows Hall
 - Lab: Wed 2-6 PM | 1110B Etcheverry Hall

## Prerequisites

All students must have completed coursework in introductory nuclear physics
([NE 101](https://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/courses/ne-101) or equivalent) and the
undergraduate radiation instrumentation laboratory 
([NE 104](https://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/courses/ne-104) or equivalent).
Graduate standing required for enrollment. 

Additional coursework including introductory signals and systems 
([EE 20](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee20/archives.html), BioE 165 or
equivalent) and introduction to imaging 
([NE 107](https://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/courses/ne-107) would be beneficial but
is not required.

## Course texts

There is no required textbook for the course. The following textbooks are
recommended:

 - Glenn F. Knoll, [Radiation Detection and Measurement, 4th Ed](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Radiation+Detection+and+Measurement,+4th+Edition-p-9780470131480)
 - Helmuth Spieler, [Semiconductor Detector Systems](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/semiconductor-detector-systems-9780198527848?cc=us&lang=en&)
 - Gordon Gilmore, [Practical Gamma-ray Spectrometry](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9780470861981)

The following are excellent references for collaborative, reproducible
workflows for scientific computing:

 - Huff & Scopatz, [Effective Computation in Physics](http://physics.codes/)
 - Chacon & Straub, [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

## Computation

This course is structured around modern best-practices for reproducibility and
collaboration in technical investigation.
Further details on the motivation and structuring of the course can be found
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06145).
While not required, it is strongly recommended that students use a 
\*NIX-flavored OS, preferably one of the many distributions of Linux.
For students who do not have such systems available, a virtual machine running
Ubuntu 16.04 is provided that has been pre-configured with all of the tools
used in the course (git, scientific python, LaTeX, etc.).
The VM is available for download 
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nhj6i0xxtroobgq/AAC1Xr0_G50c6V1zJik6gjPfa?dl=0),
and can be run with Oracle VirtualBox.
The password for the **student** user in the VM is **NE204fall2018**.
