    - Office hours: TBD

## Session Dates
 - Lecture: Tu & Th 9-10 AM | 39 Evans Hall
 - Lab: Wed 1-5 PM | 1110B Etcheverry Hall

## Prerequisites

All students must have completed coursework in introductory nuclear physics
([NE 101](https://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/courses/ne-101) or equivalent) and the
undergraduate radiation instrumentation laboratory 
([NE 104](https://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/courses/ne-104) or equivalent).
Graduate standing required for enrollment. 

Additional coursework including introductory signals and systems 
([EE 20](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee20/archives.html), BioE 165 or
equivalent) and introduction to imaging 
([NE 107](https://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/courses/ne-107) would be beneficial but
is not required.

## Course texts

There is no required textbook for the course. The following textbooks are
recommended:
