## Reproducibility and Scientific Computing

Another important objective of this course is to give students practical
experience conducting scientific research with a reproducible workflow.
Reproducibility is a foundational component of scientific investigatiion.
Without the ability to effectively communicate technical ideas and test and
replicate proposed experiments, the scientific enterprise would not
be possible.
On a more practical note, reproducibility is also a key component in 
collaborative efforts.
A ubiquitous and utterly demoralizing experience for graduate students in STEM
fields is dealing with "legacy" systems and codebases, where "things just used
to work".
The amount of effort that has been lost/wasted due to corrupted hard drives,
impenatrable and unmaintainable codebases, or an experienced post doc leaving
for a new job is both staggering and depressing.
Fortunately, these hair-loss-inducing impediments to the expansion of human
knowledge are avoidable, especially now that so much of the scientific 
endeavor takes place in the digital domain.
The primary antidote is the *reproducible* workflow.
Some key components of a reproducible workflow are:

 - Using *accessible* tools for data analysis, so that other people are able to
   test your ideas.
 - Using tools that are *tested* and maintained to minimize errors in results
 - A tight coupling between the *analysis* (e.g. code) and the *presentation of
   the results* (e.g. report).
 - Version control to keep track of changes to both the analysis that produces
   the results, and surrounding text/fluff for presenting the results.

In this course, students will implement a reproducible workflow for the lab
work using the incredibly powerful
[Python ecosystem for scientific computing](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/intro.html),
along with [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for version control and 
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), the de facto standard for generating
technical documents.

**N.B.** For a much more detailed and compelling description of reproducible
workflows (and scientific computation in general), I refer to the seminal 
textbook [Effective Computation in Physics](http://physics.codes/) by 
[Kathryn Huff](http://katyhuff.github.io/) and 
[Anthony Scopatz](http://www.ergs.sc.edu/people/scopatz.html).
