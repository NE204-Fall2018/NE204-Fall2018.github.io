Due to time-intensive nature of the laboratory investigations and the large
enrollment, not every student will be participating in *every* listed lab.
Instead, all students will conduct lab experiments focusing on DSP with 
coaxial HPGe detectors, then will be responsible for selecting from the
[list of potential experiments]({filename}/labs/writeups.md) for the third lab
report.
