## Reading Assignments

**Opinion Warning:** The whole "pay to view the results of publicly funded
research" paradigm that for whatever insane reason is entrenched in modern
scientific publication is
[a crime against humanity](https://www.nature.com/news/open-access-the-true-cost-of-science-publishing-1.12676).
That being said... I'm not trying to get sued by the likes of Elsevier et al.,
so I will be linking to all of the articles through the publisher portals.

Since you are Berkeley students, you should have access to (and the ability to
download) all of the articles whenever you're on a Berkeley or LBL network.
You can also get access to the articles when you're not physically on the 
Berkeley network by using the 
[VPN](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/using-the-libraries/vpn) services offered by
the Berkeley library.

#### 1. Shockley-Ramo | Due: Tuesday, 01-23-2018

The first reading assignment includes *two* papers: the original papers on
charge induction from charge-carrier motion that comprise the
Shockley-Ramo theorem (see Knoll Appendix D for a brief review).

  1. [W. Shockley "Currents to Conductors Induced by a Moving Point Charge](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1710367)
  2. [S. Ramo "Currents Induced by Election Motion"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1686997/?reload=true)
