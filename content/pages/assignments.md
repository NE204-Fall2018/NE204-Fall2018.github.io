Links to reading assignments and lab writeups will be posted here as they
are assigned, along with their corresponding due dates.

## Reading Assignments

**Opinion Warning:** The whole "pay to view the results of publicly funded
research" paradigm that for whatever insane reason is entrenched in modern
scientific publication is
[a crime against humanity](https://www.nature.com/news/open-access-the-true-cost-of-science-publishing-1.12676).
That being said... I'm not trying to get sued by the likes of Elsevier et al.,
so I will be linking to all of the articles through the publisher portals.

Since you are Berkeley students, you should have access to (and the ability to
download) all of the articles whenever you're on a Berkeley or LBL network.
You can also get access to the articles when you're not physically on the 
Berkeley network by using the 
[VPN](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/using-the-libraries/vpn) services offered by
the Berkeley library.

#### 1. Shockley-Ramo | Due: Tuesday, 01-23-2018

The first reading assignment includes *two* papers: the original papers on
charge induction from charge-carrier motion that comprise the
Shockley-Ramo theorem (see Knoll Appendix D for a brief review).

  1. [W. Shockley "Currents to Conductors Induced by a Moving Point Charge](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1710367)
  2. [S. Ramo "Currents Induced by Election Motion"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1686997/?reload=true)

#### 2. Knoll Chapters 11 and 12 | Due: Tuesday, 01-30-2018

Please review chapters 11 and 12 in Knoll.
It is essential that you have a firm understanding of the basics of 
semiconductor detector operation as we begin taking data with the HPGe 
detectors in the lab.
If you do not have a personal copy of Knoll, there are several available in
1110B that you may borrow for this assignment.

#### 3. [Low-Noise Techniques in Detectors - Veljko Radeka](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ns.38.120188.001245) | Due: 02-13-2018

This reading is a bit longer (~60 pages) and quite detailed, but offers an 
incredible summary of many of the topics we have been and will continue 
discussing for the next several weeks.
If you only took one thing away from this class, you could do worse than a
thorough understanding of this review.
I strongly recommend dedicating quite a bit of time to this reading, along with
multiple discussions with your peers.
