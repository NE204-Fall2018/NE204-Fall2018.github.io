title: Lab Report Rubric
article-order: 03
date: 01-10-2018

Lab reports will be submitted individually, with one github repository per
student per lab.

Lab reports will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

### Successful Build (10%)

The lab report is successfully generated from the source.
The largest consideration for this portion of the evaluation is whether the
provided code produces the expected results from the given data.
Compatibility issues are expected: students will not be penalized if the
attempted compilation of the report does not work perfectly on the first try.
As long as the student is responsive and prompt in resolving any reported
issues, points will not be subtracted for failed compilations.

### Code Testing (10%)

Ten percent of the lab report grade will go towards an evaluation of the tests 
provided with the data analysis code.
Code testing is not the focus of these labs, so the test suite is not 
expected to exhaustively test every piece of code written by the students.
The goal here is more to get students used to the habit of writing tests for
their data analysis code.
One effective way of generating relevant tests is to implement "thought
experiments".
For example, if you have designed a trapezoidal pulse shaping filter, how do
you expect it to perform on a pulse with negative input polarity?
Evaluating this experiment, and then implementing it in the form of a test is
an example of an effective unit test.
Another source of unit test cases is to write a test any time you encounter a
bug or unexpected behavior in your code.
There is no explicit requirement on coverage (i.e. you don't have to have at
least one test for each function/method you write), but some degree of testing
should be undertaken.


### Introduction / Motivation (15%)

All lab reports should have an introduction that provides an over view of
what is being studied in the lab, and a motivation for why the particular 
study is being undertaken.

### Methods / Theory

### Results / Discussion
