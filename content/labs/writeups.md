title: Lab Writeups
article-order: 01
date: 01-10-2018

Links to the writeups for the experiments can be found here.
Labs 0, 1, and 2 are required for all students.
Subsequent labs are subject to time and equipment constraints.

## Required

 - [Lab 0: HPGe Energy Calibration]({filename}/downloads/lab0_writeup.pdf)
 - [Lab 1: Digital Signal Processing for Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy in HPGe]({filename}/downloads/lab1_writeup.pdf)
 - [Lab 2: Digital Signal Processing for Pulse Shape Analysis and Timing in HPGe]({filename}/downloads/lab2_writeup.pdf)

## Rotating

As mentioned, we have neither the time nor the equipment to allow every student
to conduct each lab.
The writeups in this section are provided to expose students to some of the
possible options for lab 3, or to provide inspiration for final project
proposals.

 - [Lab 4: Neutron Detection and Pulse Shape Discrimination in Liquid Scintillators]({filename}/downloads/lab4_writeup.pdf)  
 - [Lab 5: Position Determination in HPGe Strip Detectors]({filename}/downloads/lab5_writeup.pdf)
 - [Lab 6: Experimental Determination of Mobility Lifetime Product in HPGe Strip Detectors]({filename}/downloads/lab6_writeup.pdf)
